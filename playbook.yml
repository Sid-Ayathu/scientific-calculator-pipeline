      # Bypassing the docker_container module for this interactive task.
      # We use the 'shell' module to execute the exact 'docker run' command.
      # This provides a more direct connection to the container's TTY,
      # which should resolve the issue of the menu not appearing.
      # The '--rm' flag automatically removes the container when it exits.
